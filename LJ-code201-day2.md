# LJ Code 201 - Day 2

So today we learned about a few more elements in CSS along with some JS control flow and Git branching. Most of the stuff was review for me except for Git branching. I think the most valuable thing for me so far is learning version control with Git since I mostly use TeamForge (crappy version control) and it was nowhere near as friendly as GitHub. I was fortunately decently trained on Python and SQL so I can really focus on Git and all the options available in HTML/CSS.

I suppose getting ahead though is quite alright though since I learned a little bit about publishing my html/css/js as a website you can launch via branching: https://quantumarchive.github.io/about_me/

That was really awesome. I'm really starting to get a feel for how once develops the front end and I really appreciate the work and thought that goes into it. Let's see what happens next!
