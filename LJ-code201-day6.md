# LJ Code 201 - Day 6

Today we went over some pretty heavy stuff for many of the people new to objects. Fortunately, most of this was review for me and when we had to make the javascript code to do all the rendering of the data in html, it came pretty quick for me. I think moving forward though, mastering how to talk to the html via the javascript will come with challenges as I learn how to organize increasingly complex pages. The thing that really threw me off today and kept me busy though was the CSS. There's so many ways to put a page together, it's like assembling a puzzle and trying to make each piece work. I still can't quite style my pages to exactly how I envision them, but I'm sure that comes with time. It was also an a-ha moment today when I Aaron told me that to stretch out some div elements, sometimes it means messing with the html tag directly in CSS. Some clarity after so long! Like I said, right now, the only thing that slows me down is the CSS, thinking things out programmatically and trying to make code as modular and generalized as possible are were I think I excel. Really looking foward to what the next class brings and being able to use object constructors. Building 5 individual objects and manipulating function codes with each one at a time once I find a bug is very frustrating.
