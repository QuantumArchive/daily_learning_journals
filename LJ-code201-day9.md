# LJ Code 201 - Day 9

Today was mostly going over review of any concepts in javascript that was confusing people, which gave me time to re-cement the fundamentals. We also learned some new CSS tricks here, but I wish we went over event handling a little more just because those are so key for developing a web page. Again, I saw it even today, if you want to slow me down, give me a CSS project. My problem is I'm too particular with design that it becomes more challenging to make things modular (I guess that's part of the beauty of style guides). I find a lot of redundant CSS when I double check which is frustrating. I managed to get through one stretch goal this evening which was to be able to update the sales page with new info for any old entries which made me mess more with node object methods which was fun. It's fascinating having to learn all the different spectrums of development one has to understand, but I think HTML and modifying it with JS is actual a clever way to teach OOP. I had to learn how to work with data structures first so it was more challenging dealing with object extraction and nodes then what it is now. But trial by fire is sometimes really good. Let's see what tomorrow brings.
