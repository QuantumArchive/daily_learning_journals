#Learning Journal - Day 17

Today, I worked with Steven to set out the core CSS of our website. This was pretty fun to mess with, but as you try to get those few extra pixels in alignment can take 30 minutes to an hour. I feel even as you understand the CSS better, it can truly be time consuming because everything has to be just right to look good. I can see why some people are hired to solely work the front-end and also the importance of things like A/B testing. One thing I've also noticed is that when I explain things, I reflect on my methods and often see myself as being a little too abrasive. I need to learn to be a little more easy going and humble in how I teach. I'm often learning myself and I appreciate it when a teacher can sympathize with my lack of understanding. Something to think about in terms of improving my soft skills. Definitely having fun though with it all and really looking forward to working in the back end.
