#Learning Journal - Day 10

Today, again I realized that being a good coder is much more holistic then simply knowing how to code. Working well in teams and communication are so key, especially as code becomes much more complex with time. Not just that, but also the feeling of relying on someone to do a portion of code I work with gives me a small amount of anxiety. Working with Sharon and seeing her knowledge of CSS was quite amazing. I think another important skill that we talked about was debugging and getting to get clarity on try/catch blocks was really useful. I used it mostly just to force certain things in code back in the day when they didn't naturally compile, and seeing as how it's important for not crashing servers, makes me appreciate it more. Looking forward to next week.
