#Learning Journal - Day 14

Today we building out a wireframe and it was quite instructive seeing the logic of how Aaron built out the webpage. I got a better feeling for organization and floating elements thanks to that. The trick now comes when remember them. Also we briefly went over CSS animations and got to even read about a few. They are pretty crazy and I'd love to learn some of the more intense ones. It seems to trick is knowing what you want the element to do in some time lapse motion i.e. at 15% of the time, 30% of the time, however long your transition may appear to be. Afterwards we got to begin brainstorming ideas for a group project. We named our team SCuTtling for Steven, Chris and Tom since we'll be working on it. We'll be making matching game as a team. This will be interesting to code, but definitely looking forward to it. This is my first time really trying to organize how we code as a team, so I look forward to seeing the end product and learning how to actually work from one common repo.
