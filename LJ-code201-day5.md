# LJ Code 201 - Day 5

So for today, we reviewed the idea of forking and branching and version control using git. It's still one of my sore spots but I think that will just come with time (I know when I first started out programming, my first while loop ended up being an infinite loop). I think we can move a little faster with the CSS (really that's just something we need to play with since most designs are fairly easy to learn). I am happy we got more function testing for those newer to programming since it also helps me to think about the problem in new ways. If there's one thing I've learned, even with my experience I do make some silly mistakes in my code, which is fine. Really the challenge for me here on out is making sure I get my workflow correct, consistent, and fast or I can have many developers screaming at me.
