#Learning Journal - Day 12

Today we started learning about calling different libraries using chart.js. Fortunately, I'm familiar with api calls to data analysis libraries in python. The one thing I dislike about chart.js at the moment is the fact that getting data into your chart feels rather unintuitive. That may change with time however as I get familiar with it. I know that matplot.lib on python is also pretty unintuitive for displaying data. For whatever reason, right now the challenge is making code modularity.
