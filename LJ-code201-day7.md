# LJ Code 201 - Day 7

So today, we were able to use constructors for our location objects instead of using literals and building everything from scratch. I love when I don't have to repeat code and just build objects in a modular fashion. I used a few more advanced techniques today such as using a ternary operator to evaluate how many workers are needed at a given site based on how many customers were there. Not sure if it was explicitly stated, but I found being able to return a reference to a given html node was quite useful for initiating the table and is great for modular design. Again, today it was the CSS that gave me the most head scratches since it's not as much logical as knowing all the available options out there and puzzle piecing them together.

One of the current things that is frustrating me in JavaScript is trying to make a modular function for populating my tables. At the moment, whenever I call render for each object, they product a table row with all the given data for both the cookies sold at a given hour and the number of people needed to work at that hour. So I return a reference to two different rows. My current populate table function takes in the table body nodes produced from the create table function I made. But I have to declare each table body node instead of passing it a list. The issue is when I call render on a given object, I get two table rows, one for each table I produced. If I were to pass it an array that contains a reference to my table body objects, I might be able to pass the returned values from a render to each individual table body node, but I'm not sure if that's optimum. My goal is to make sure I do not hit render twice on a given object otherwise I'll overwrite the existing values.
