# LJ Code 201 - Day 4

So today we were learning more CSS tricks dealing with float and other techniques for organizing the structure of our page. I also learned more about forking and pair programming. It goes to show that even when you know how to program in a given language to do tasks like Python and JS, there's still a lot of other key software development skills that you need to be successful. I also started learning what it means to have someone else work on your code, and being a control freak, that can be a little scary. Not a terrible control freak, but certainly I agonize a lot over whether the logic/etc. will get messed up. So what this teaches me is that I need to be more patient with people and help bring them up to be a better programmer, not just build myself up. I also ended up learning a lot by getting to peer mentor a bit and help the other person work out the logic. This has been a great experience, but it's getting harder to keep everything together with so little time. Glad the weekend is coming up.
