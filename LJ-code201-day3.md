# LJ Code 201 - Day 3

Today, again I saw how I learn faster by coding and making mistakes. I had to struggle through the fact that in my javascript, that if you enter a blank value you get a 0 length string. By coercing that string into a number, you get 0. But if you coerce an actual string, say 'string', you get NaN. This made it so that when I was running the variable through my control flow, my check to see if the users value was lower then the randomly generated value would evaluate true (since 0 was always outside the range of values I set). This made it so that I was incrementing a counter reducing the number of the users guesses (e.g. was using a while loop and then switched to a for loop). I managed to solve this by first checking if the entrance was a 0 length string, and then seeing if a string was entered when the value was coerced using Number(), and if it passed those checks it would then compare the value inputted by the user vs. the randomly generated number. It was pretty dang cool and satisfying to see it all working and I learned a lot more about javascript. One thing though that I miss about Python are the functional programming aspects like map(), but I learned that JS can do the same, but that is for later. Looking forward to the next lesson!.
